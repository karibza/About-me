# ◸ About Me ◿
→ I'm 14 years old; I speak Russian and English.

→ I don't mind to talk with you when I'm not busy(offtab) or already talking\sitting with someone else.

→ I use only **Telegram** and **Discord**, don't ask for my other socials or my phone number: I also never text on socials first, it doesn't mean I forgot about you or don't want to talk to you; I don't check Discord until I know and sure that someone texted me there, so I sometimes can not respond for weeks.

→ Sometimes I can not respond but be sure that I readed your text: I often can just ignore when my friends is online or not feeling like I want to talk.

# ◸ Nickname in PT ◿
**W2I** = I may not respond to you in global chat because I'm probably offtab or afk but can see the screen;
I actually use W2I most of the time, even when I'm talking with friends.

**OFFTAB** = I'm doing something and I can't check tabs often, so I may not respond immediately.

**DNIUID** = Do not interact until I do! Just don't interact until I will and it will be good.

Also, feel free to C+H with me, I don't mind if you will cover me or something else.

I don't have it... I don't really care, I can keep the conversation going with any theme basically, but don't talk about disturbing themes all the time, such as 18-21+, gore, addictions, weapons, psychologic, mental disorders. I don't mind black humour so you can tell any jokes around me.

# ◸ You want to be friends with me? ◿
And You sure about it?

If you really want to befriend me, then say it right away, because I see that most people is afraid to talk to me, for some reason,,, but you won't make me mad!

I just don't consider someone a friend if we know each other for less than a couple of weeks and we talked and played together no more than one time... Yeah I need constant communication with my friends.
